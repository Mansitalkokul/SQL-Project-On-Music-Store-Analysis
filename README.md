# SQL-Project-On-Music-Store-Analysis
In This Project I have taken data from Music Store to analyse and solve their queries. I use data of different csv files related to music store containing different record.
Tables are Artist,Album,Track,Media_Type,Genre,Playlist_Track,Playlist,Invoice_line,Invoice,Customer,Employee etc.
They are interconnected as shown in schemas.
Solving thee questions related to the Music Store in Oracle sql is fun and littlebit challaging also.

Thanks!
